                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Computer Science senior student at Zhejiang University (ZJU), where I will continue my academic journey as a PhD student. My research interests lie at the intersection of programming languages, deep learning systems, and software engineering.</p>
                <p>I am particularly fascinated by the internals of popular programming languages and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. My current research focuses on leveraging software engineering tools, specifically program analysis and testing techniques, to enhance AI systems.</p>

                    <h3>ðŸš€ Building This Website with Windsurf</h3>
                    <p>âš¡ This website was created in just one minute using Windsurf, a revolutionary AI-powered IDE! I was amazed by how the AI programming agent could not only design and implement a professional academic website but also handle the GitHub deployment process automatically.</p>
                    <p>ðŸŽ¯ As someone researching AI systems, I found this experience particularly exciting. It showcased the potential of AI agents in software development. However, there was an interesting learning moment: while the agent expertly handled the code creation and git operations, it initially overlooked mentioning the need for GitHub Pages settings configuration. This small oversight actually reinforces my belief that human-AI collaboration is key - we complement each other's strengths and catch each other's blind spots.</p>
                    <p>âœ¨ This experience aligns perfectly with my research interests in making AI systems more reliable and efficient. It's exciting to be both a researcher in this field and a user benefiting from these advancing technologies!</p>
